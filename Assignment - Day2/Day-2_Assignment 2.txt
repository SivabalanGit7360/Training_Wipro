Assignment 2:

Write a recursive function pseudocode and calculate the nth Fibonacci number and use Big O notation to analyze its efficiency. 
Compare this with an iterative approach and discuss the pros and cons in terms of space and time complexity.

Recursive:

Function recursiveFibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
    return n
    else:
    return recursiveFibonacci(n - 1) + recursiveFibonacci(n - 2)
Iterative:

Function iterativeFibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
    return n
    else:
    fib = 1
    prev = 1
    for i from 2 to n:
    temp = fib
    fib = fib + prev
    prev = temp
    return fib
